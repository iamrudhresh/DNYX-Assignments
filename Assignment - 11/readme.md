# Fetch and Display Bacon Ipsum Data

This assignment involves creating a web application that fetches data from the [Bacon Ipsum API](https://baconipsum.com/api/?type=all) using the Fetch API and displays it on a webpage.

## Requirements

### 1. Create HTML Structure
- Set up a basic HTML structure with an appropriate layout for displaying the fetched data.
- Include HTML elements to showcase the fetched data.

### 2. Fetch Bacon Ipsum Data Using Fetch API (GET method)
- Write JavaScript code to fetch data from the Bacon Ipsum API using the Fetch API.
- Utilize the `fetch` function to make a GET request to the Bacon Ipsum API endpoint: `https://baconipsum.com/api/?type=all`.

### 3. Display Fetched Data
- Update the HTML elements dynamically to display the bacon ipsum text fetched from the API.
- Choose creative ways to present the data, such as creating a paragraph, list, or any format you prefer.

### 4. Handle Errors
- Implement error handling for the fetch operation. Use `.catch()` to handle any errors that may occur during the fetch.

### 5. Create a Postman Collection and Test API (GET method):
- Open [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and sign in or create an account if you don't have one.
   - Click on the "Collections" tab on the left sidebar.
   - Click the "New Collection" button, give it a name (e.g., Bacon Ipsum API), and save it.
   - In the newly created collection, click the "Add Request" button.
   - Name the request (e.g., Fetch Bacon Ipsum Data).
   - Choose the HTTP method as GET.
   - Enter the API endpoint: `https://baconipsum.com/api/?type=all`.
   - Save the request to the collection.

### 5. Styling [ Optional ]
- Apply CSS styling to enhance the visual appeal of the fetched data on the webpage.
- Ensure a responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Submission Guidelines

- Organize your code with proper indentation and comments for clarity and Sumbit it in GCR.

## Bonus

- Add a button or a feature to dynamically refresh the bacon ipsum text.
- Implement a loading indicator to inform users that data is being fetched.

## Note

This assignment is designed to help you practice working with the Fetch API, specifically using the GET method to retrieve data from the Bacon Ipsum API. Focus on handling asynchronous operations, displaying dynamic data on a webpage, and creating a user-friendly interface.

Good luck with your assignment!
