## Theory

- **When and why do we need `lazy()`?**
- **What is suspense?**
- **Why did we get this error: "A component suspended while responding to synchronous input. This will cause the UI to be replaced with a loading indicator. To fix, updates that suspend should be wrapped with `startTransition`"? How does suspense fix this error?**
- **Advantages and disadvantages of using this code splitting pattern?**
- **When do we and why do we need suspense?**

## Coding

- **Create your custom hooks**
- **Try out `lazy` and `suspense`**
- **Make your code clean.**
