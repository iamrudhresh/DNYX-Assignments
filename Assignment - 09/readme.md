# Update Password Form with Firebase Realtime Database Integration

In this extended assignment, you will enhance the "Update Password" form by integrating Firebase Realtime Database functionality. Follow the instructions below to achieve the given functionality.

## Instructions

1. **Firebase Setup:**
   - Set up a Firebase project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Create a Realtime Database in your Firebase project.

2. **HTML Form Modification:**
   - Open the HTML file where you implemented the "Update Password" form.
   - Add the Firebase JavaScript SDK to your HTML file.
   - Initialize Firebase using the configuration settings obtained from the Firebase Console.

3. **JavaScript Form Handling with Firebase:**
   - Modify the JavaScript code handling the "Update Password" form to integrate with Firebase.
   - When the form is submitted, use the Firebase SDK to update the user's password in the Realtime Database.
   - Store the user's password securely in the Realtime Database.

4. **Firebase Database Structure:**
   - Define a suitable structure for storing user information in the Firebase Realtime Database. For example, create a "users" node where each user has an associated "password" field.

5. **UI Feedback:**
   - Provide appropriate feedback to the user after the password update, indicating success or failure.
   - Display any error messages returned by Firebase in case of a failure.

## Example Database Structure

```plaintext
- your-firebase-project-id
  - users
    - userId1
      - password: "hashed_password_1"
    - userId2
      - password: "hashed_password_2"
    ...
```

## Submission Guidelines

1. **Update your existing code with the Firebase integration.**
   - Integrate Firebase into your existing HTML and JavaScript code. Include the Firebase JavaScript SDK and initialize Firebase using the configuration settings obtained from the Firebase Console.
   - Check the step-by-step guidance available in the Google Classroom for Firebase integration.

2. **Ensure that the form updates the user's password in the Realtime Database upon submission.**
   - Modify the JavaScript code handling the "Update Password" form to use the Firebase SDK to update the user's password in the Realtime Database.

3. **Handle errors gracefully and provide feedback to the user.**
   - Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle errors that may occur during the password update process. Provide feedback to the user indicating success or failure.

4. **Reset the form upon submission.**
   - Ensure that the form is reset after a successful password update. This helps in providing a better user experience for subsequent password updates.


5. **Submit the JavaScript file in Google Classroom.**
   - After completing the integration and testing, submit the JavaScript file containing your updated code in the Google Classroom assignment.

6. **Check GCR for FireBase Notes**
   - I Have Mention that detailed Firebase integration guidance is available in the Google Classroom.

## Note

This extended assignment aims to reinforce the concepts of integrating web forms with backend services, particularly using Firebase Realtime Database in this case.

Feel free to customize the instructions based on your class's coverage of Firebase and backend integration concepts.
