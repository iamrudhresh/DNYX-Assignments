### Create a Postman Collection and Test API (GET method)

1. **Create a Postman Collection:**
   - Open [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and sign in or create an account if you don't have one.
   - Click on the "Collections" tab on the left sidebar.
   - Click the "New Collection" button, give it a name (e.g., Bacon Ipsum API), and save it.

2. **Add a GET Request to the Collection:**
   - In the newly created collection, click the "Add Request" button.
   - Name the request (e.g., Fetch Bacon Ipsum Data).
   - Choose the HTTP method as GET.
   - Enter the API endpoint: `https://baconipsum.com/api/?type=all`.
   - Save the request to the collection.

3. **Test the GET Request:**
   - Click on the newly created request in the collection.
   - Click the "Send" button to execute the GET request.
   - Review the response in the Postman interface to ensure you are getting the expected data.

4. **Documentation: [ Optional ]**
   - In your README file, provide instructions on how to import your Postman Collection.
   - Include any necessary environment variables or configurations if applicable.

### Submit the Screen Shot of Postman Collection in Google Classroom.

**Note:** Creating and testing requests in Postman is a valuable skill for API development. Ensure that your GET request successfully fetches data from the Bacon Ipsum API and includes relevant details in the response.
